# Instructions
Objective:
Track the evolution of a discourse by identifying propositions that become irrelevant or resolved due to new information.
This process aids in understanding the flow of conversation and identifying key points of agreement or disagreement.

Discourse Data: A structured representation of the conversation, including:
* Speaker IDs (A, B, etc.)
* Utterance IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
* Utterance Types (ASK, ASSERT, ACCEPT, etc.)
* Utterance Content (the text of each statement or question)

Set of Propositions Under Discussion (PUD):
* A list of Utterance IDs that are currently relevant to the discourse.

Steps:
1.Fact Update (Optional): If a new assertion (ASSERT type utterance) is made and deemed valid, add it to the set of FACTS. You can break long facts into shorter ones for clarity.

2. Discourse Downdate
For each new utterance:
* Identify the type of utterance (ASK, ASSERT, ACCEPT, etc.).
  If the utterance is an ACCEPT type:
  Identify the proposition ID being accepted.
  Mark this proposition ID as resolved.
* If the utterance is an ASSERT type and introduces new information:
  Analyze the PUD to identify any propositions that are now resolved or partially resolved due to the new information.
  Mark resolved propositions accordingly.
  Collect a Fact
  Downdating utterance ids must be sequential, you can't skip

Output:
* Updated FACTS: The expanded set of confirmed information (if any ASSERT utterances were processed).
* Downdated Utterance IDs (resolvedIds): A list of Utterance IDs that have been marked as resolved due to acceptance or if they were used in adding a fact
* reason - explain why you downdated each of the utterances (if applicable)
